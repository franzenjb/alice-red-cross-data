## üéØ WHAT MAKES THIS VALUABLE

### The Problem We Solved:

**You Started With:**
- Red Cross county assignments
- 62 counties missing Census demographics
- No ALICE financial hardship data
- No geographic boundaries for mapping

**You Now Have:**
- ‚úÖ Complete Census demographics (filled in 60 missing counties)
- ‚úÖ ALICE financial hardship data (3,066 counties)
- ‚úÖ Geographic boundaries at 4 organizational levels
- ‚úÖ Properly aggregated statistics for Chapter/Region/Division
- ‚úÖ Ready-to-upload GeoJSON files for ArcGIS Online

### Why This Matters for Choropleths:

**Before:** You had a spreadsheet with county names but no way to map it

**Now:** You have:
1. **Geographic shapes** (polygons for counties/chapters/regions/divisions)
2. **Complete data** (Census + ALICE) attached to each shape
3. **Multiple scales** (can map at county OR chapter OR region OR division level)
4. **Filtering capability** (can filter counties by Chapter/Region/Division)

**This means you can create:**
- Choropleth maps colored by ANY of 81 variables
- Interactive maps where users filter by Chapter/Region/Division
- Dashboards with charts and indicators
- Experience Builder apps with dropdowns and tables

## üìä KEY VARIABLES FOR CHOROPLETH MAPPING

### Top 10 Most Useful:

1. **ALICE_Below_ALICE_Threshold_Percentage** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
   - % of households struggling financially
   - Best overall hardship indicator
   - Use red color scheme (light to dark)

2. **ALICE_Poverty_Percentage**
   - % in extreme poverty
   - Shows most critical need areas

3. **ALICE_ALICE_Percentage**
   - % working but still struggling
   - Shows "working poor" populations

4. **Med_HH_Inc_2023**
   - Median household income
   - Use green color scheme
   - Higher = better capacity

5. **Pop_2023**
   - Total population
   - Shows service area size
   - Use blue color scheme

6. **Unemp_Rate_2023**
   - Unemployment rate
   - Economic indicator
   - Use red color scheme

7. **Median_Age_2023**
   - Median age
   - Shows demographic profile
   - Use orange/brown scheme

8. **Homeownership_Pct** (Chapter/Region/Division only)
   - % homeowners vs renters
   - Economic stability indicator

9. **Hispanic_Pct** / **Black_Pct** / **White_Pct**
   - Race/ethnicity composition
   - Important for equity analysis

10. **Seniors_65_up_Pop_2023**
    - Senior population
    - Shows vulnerable populations

## üí° PRO TIPS

### County vs Chapter vs Region Files:

**Use COUNTY file when:**
- You want detailed, granular data
- You're analyzing specific areas
- You want to filter by Chapter/Region/Division

**Use CHAPTER file when:**
- You want chapter-level comparisons
- Map is zoomed to state/regional level
- Analyzing Red Cross chapter performance

**Use REGION file when:**
- Creating strategic overview
- Multi-state analysis
- Executive-level dashboards

**Use DIVISION file when:**
- National overview needed
- Comparing major geographic areas
- Board-level presentations

### Color Scheme Guide:

| Variable Type | Color Scheme | Why |
|---------------|--------------|-----|
| Financial hardship, poverty | Red (light ‚Üí dark) | Red = concern, darker = worse |
| Income, resources | Green (dark ‚Üí light) | Green = money, darker = more |
| Population, households | Blue (light ‚Üí dark) | Blue = neutral |
| Age | Orange/Brown | Warm = mature |
| Rates (unemployment) | Red | Red = problem |

### Classification Guide:

- **Natural Breaks** - Best for most demographic data
- **Quantile** - Equal # features per class
- **Equal Interval** - Even steps (good for percentages)
- **5 classes** - Sweet spot for readability
