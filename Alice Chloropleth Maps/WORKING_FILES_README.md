## üé® **CREATING CHOROPLETH MAPS**

### **Key Fields for Mapping:**

#### **redcross-counties.zip:**
- `ALICE_Be_1` = ALICE_Below_ALICE_Threshold_Percentage (Combined poverty + ALICE %)
- `ALICE_Po_1` = ALICE_Poverty_Percentage (Poverty rate %)
- `ALICE_AL_3` = ALICE_ALICE_Percentage (ALICE rate %)
- `Chapter` = Red Cross Chapter
- `Region` = Red Cross Region
- `Division` = Red Cross Division
- `Pop_2023` = Total population
- `Med_HH_Inc` = Median household income
- `Median_Age` = Median age
- `Unemp_Rate` = Unemployment rate
- `Diversity_` = Diversity index

#### **alice_counties_2023_CORRECTED.zip:**
- `Combined_R` = Combined_Rate_Pct (Poverty + ALICE %)
- `ALICE_Rate` = ALICE_Rate_Pct (ALICE only %)
- `Poverty_Ra` = Poverty_Rate_Pct (Poverty only %)
- `RC_Chapter` = Red Cross Chapter
- `RC_Region` = Red Cross Region
- `RC_Divisio` = Red Cross Division
- `Pop_2023` = Total population
- `Med_HH_Inc` = Median household income

### **Recommended Choropleth Settings:**

**For Vulnerability Analysis:**
- **Field:** `ALICE_Be_1` (redcross) or `Combined_R` (alice)
- **Method:** Natural Breaks
- **Classes:** 5
- **Colors:** Green (low) ‚Üí Red (high)

**For Income Analysis:**
- **Field:** `Med_HH_Inc`
- **Method:** Natural Breaks
- **Classes:** 5
- **Colors:** Red (low) ‚Üí Green (high)

**For Population:**
- **Field:** `Pop_2023`
- **Method:** Quantile
- **Classes:** 5

## üìä **FIELD NAME REFERENCE**

### **Important: Shapefile 10-Character Limit**

Shapefiles truncate field names to 10 characters. Here's a quick reference:

| Truncated | Full Name | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `ALICE_Be_1` | ALICE_Below_ALICE_Threshold_Percentage | **PRIMARY METRIC** - Combined poverty + ALICE rate % |
| `ALICE_Po_1` | ALICE_Poverty_Percentage | Poverty rate % |
| `ALICE_AL_3` | ALICE_ALICE_Percentage | ALICE rate % (working poor) |
| `Med_HH_Inc` | Med_HH_Inc_2023 | Median household income |
| `Pop_2023` | Pop_2023 | Total population |
| `Median_Age` | Median_Age_2023 | Median age |
| `Unemp_Rate` | Unemp_Rate_2023 | Unemployment rate % |
| `Diversity_` | Diversity_Index_2023 | Diversity index |
| `Male_Pop_2` | Male_Pop_2023 | Male population |
| `Female_Pop` | Female_Pop_2023 | Female population |

## üîç **WHICH FILE SHOULD I USE?**

### **Use redcross-counties.zip when:**
‚úÖ You need full Red Cross organizational data
‚úÖ You want complete demographic fields (82 total)
‚úÖ You're filtering by Chapter/Region/Division
‚úÖ File size isn't a concern (11.8 MB is fine)
‚úÖ **This is the RECOMMENDED file for most users**

### **Use alice_counties_2023_CORRECTED.zip when:**
‚úÖ You need complete US coverage (all 3,221 counties including territories)
‚úÖ You want smaller file size (1.9 MB)
‚úÖ You only need key ALICE and demographic fields
‚úÖ Some missing Red Cross assignments are acceptable

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### **ZIP Codes and Places Files - NOT AVAILABLE**

**The ZIP code and Places files have been removed because they contained incorrect data.**

- 68% of ZIP codes had "Not Assigned" for Chapter/Region
- The remaining 32% had **wrong chapter assignments** (e.g., Detroit ZIP showing Texas chapter)
- The County FIPS join logic was fundamentally flawed

**These files will NOT be recreated.** If you need sub-county analysis, consider:
1. Using county-level data as the finest granularity
2. Creating custom ZIP code aggregations in ArcGIS Online after upload
3. Waiting for proper ALICE ZIP code data with correct Red Cross assignments
