  - Population by age groups, gender
  - Racial/ethnic composition
  - Household characteristics
  - Employment & unemployment
  - Income (median, average, per capita)
  - Housing (values, owner vs renter)
  - Diversity index

### Data Overlap
- **2,666 counties** have BOTH ALICE + Red Cross data

## 🎯 PART 2: THE BIG IDEA - MASTER INTEGRATION STRATEGY

### Core Concept: "The Red Cross ALICE Intelligence Platform"

**Every single ALICE location (county, ZIP, place, sub-county) gets assigned:**
1. Red Cross Chapter
2. Red Cross Region
3. Red Cross Division
4. Full organizational hierarchy

**How?**
- Counties: Direct FIPS matching
- Sub-county (ZIP/Place/Sub_County): Extract parent county FIPS from GeoID, inherit chapter assignment

### The Result:
**A unified dataset of 87,389 enriched records where every location knows:**
- Its ALICE vulnerability metrics (poverty, financial stress)
- Its Red Cross organizational home
- Its full demographics
- Its geographic context
- Its time-series trends (2010-2023)
