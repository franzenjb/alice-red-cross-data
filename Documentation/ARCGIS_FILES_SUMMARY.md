## üîÑ DATA UPDATE WORKFLOW

When new ALICE data becomes available:

1. **Update Master CSV:**
   - Replace `alice_master_database.csv` with new data

2. **Re-run Enrichment:**
   - Run previous enrichment script to create new `alice_redcross_master_enriched.csv`

3. **Re-run Aggregation:**
   ```bash
   python3 aggregate_alice_for_arcgis.py
   ```

4. **Re-run GeoJSON Creation:**
   ```bash
   python3 create_arcgis_geojson.py
   ```

5. **Upload to ArcGIS Online:**
   - Overwrite existing hosted layers
   - Dashboards automatically update

**Frequency:** Quarterly (when United Way releases new ALICE data)
